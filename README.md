## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 

1. Choose a task to work on
2. Start the timer (typically 25 minutes)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. After 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

This application helps you follow this technique with a beautiful interface right in your terminal.
